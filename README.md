## Motivation
In the world of enterprise device management (EDM), there is a gey space between unmanaged devices and fully managed MDMed devices.  For some efforts, there is a need for a extremely light-weight way to uniformly configure devices without the control of mobile device management.  This project seeks to bridge that gap.
